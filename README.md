# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 data to uncover trends, visualize the spread, and provide insights into confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities over time. Using Pythonâ€™s data analysis and visualization libraries, it transforms raw datasets into meaningful information.

## ðŸ›  Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing of COVID-19 datasets
* Time-series analysis of cases, recoveries, and deaths
* Interactive and static visualizations (line plots, bar charts, maps)
* Country-wise and global trend comparisons
* Summary statistics for better understanding of the pandemicâ€™s impact

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The project uses publicly available COVID-19 datasets from reliable sources like:

* [Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
* [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://covid19.who.int/)

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** â€“ Data cleaning & manipulation
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
* **Plotly** â€“ Interactive charts (optional)
* **NumPy** â€“ Numerical operations

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd covid19-analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the analysis script:
